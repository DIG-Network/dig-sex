//! Relevance scoring — the pure "brain" the on-disk cache consults to decide WHAT to keep, WHAT to
//! sacrifice first, and WHEN a fresh candidate is worth displacing an incumbent (SPEC §3).
//!
//! Scoring orders candidates **within** a [`CacheTier`](crate::tier::CacheTier). It MUST NOT move a
//! store between tiers — that is the tier ladder's job ([`crate::tier`]), and keeping the two
//! separate is what makes the model a capacity ladder rather than one ranked list (SPEC §2.1).
//!
//! Everything here is PURE and deterministic: no clock, no network, no
//! `Instant::now`, no I/O. Time enters ONLY as caller-supplied tick counters
//! (`reads_recency_ticks`, `last_access_ticks`), so the same inputs always yield
//! the same score and eviction decisions can be replayed and audited offline.
//!
//! # The model in one paragraph
//! Every cacheable store has a [`relevance`] score — higher means "more worth
//! keeping". The PRIMARY signal is the **XOR distance** between the content id
//! and this node's peer id: content whose id lands close to our peer id in the
//! 256-bit keyspace is content this node is naturally responsible for. Around
//! that primary term sit bounded, weighted bonuses: a **replication-scarcity**
//! term (keep what few others hold), a **local-demand** term (keep what our own
//! users read), a **pin-adjacency** bonus, and a large **pinned** bonus. Score
//! only decides desirability WITHIN a [`CacheTier`](crate::tier::CacheTier); across tiers, eviction
//! precedence is fixed by the tier alone ([`evict_key`](crate::tier::evict_key)).

/// The tunable weights of the [`relevance`] weighted sum. Defaults keep the XOR
/// primary strictly dominant: no single bonus can outweigh the proximity term,
/// so the ungameable signal always leads (see [`RelevanceWeights::default`]).

/// It does NOT make naming a near key cost an on-chain mint. A peer may name ANY `(store, root)` whose
/// key falls near our `peer_id` and, on an opted-in node, make us attempt a DHT provider-lookup for it;
/// that lookup is CHEAP, and a non-existent store simply finds no providers and the pull fails there —
/// the low cost is "no providers", not a per-key mint. The on-chain-mint + merkle cost binds a LATER
/// step: actually BECOMING A CACHED HOLDER of a specific capsule. A pulled module is bound to its `root`
/// by merkle verification, and is never served as current unless that root equals the chain-anchored
/// tip (the serve-time read-path pin). Combined with the default-OFF gate on the pull, the byte-cap,
/// and the per-key single-flight, the worst a near-key attacker can extract from an opted-in node is a
/// bounded pull of REAL near-neighbourhood content — never caching of fabricated, junk, or
/// out-of-neighbourhood content.
///
/// ## Tightness
/// The midpoint is the CONSERVATIVE floor: it can only ADMIT content genuinely closer to us than
/// random, and it never rejects legitimate demand (Kademlia routes near-key requests to near-key
/// nodes, so real inbound demand at this node already sits well inside the neighbourhood). Tightening
